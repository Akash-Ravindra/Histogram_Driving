# Project 2

## Question 1
Run the [Histogram_Eq.py](./Histogram_Eq.py) file to view the output. All the images should play in a sequence, move frames by pressing any key
```bash
python Histogram_Eq.py
```
## Question 2
Run the [Lane_detection.py](./Lane_detection.py) file to view the output. The output will be frame by frame. Move frames by pressing any key on the keyboard. At any point press 's' to stop the program
To generate a video file, set the 'show' variable to False and 'save_video' to True. Found on line 4-5
```bash
python Lane_detection.py
